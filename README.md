This is where all the bee maps and results from our research will reside

Hi Native Bee Enthusiasts,

We have spent 2016 databasing archival specimen data from 25 species of bees found in the Mojave and western Sonoran Desert, checking and assigning coordinated data, deleting duplicate data to produce distribution maps for these species, which will be posted on the website.  Each dot represents a unique specimen per locality per date.
